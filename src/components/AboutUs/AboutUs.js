Laundr is a way to make room for what is most important in life. Each load of laundry takes about 4 hours from start to finish. We look proudly upon the collective thousands of hours we’ve saved, because we know that time is largely spent creating amazing things.

We have preserved days worth of time spent with beloved family members; allowed for numerous study sessions for our country’s future professionals; and enabled people to spend their valuable time on all of the things they truly care about.

Through listening to our customers’ inspiring stories, we began to shape the service into a way that supports people in their personal journeys and delivers them a little bit of extra time with every order.</p>

            <p>In addition to those stories, we also learned what our customers wanted most from their laundry. We came to understand how important the smell and feel of laundry were, and we tried hundreds of different detergents, softeners, and scent boosters to give Laundr users the ideal experience.

In doing this, we recognized that if the task of doing the perfect load of laundry was this difficult for a team of paid professionals, then there was no hope for the average busy individual. So we set out to create a laundry detergent that would make clothes smell and feel amazing, and be so easy to use that it would wash every load of laundry perfectly and consistently.</p>

            <p>

After just a few weeks of prototyping our new laundry detergent, we realized that we had arrived at something amazing. Beyond an excellent solution for cleaning Laundr orders, Laundr Bombs had a vibrant and long-lasting scent that gave us an air of exploration and adventure.

The fragrances of Laundr Bombs are much more than the various types of “soapy” smells that we are used to seeing in the detergent aisle at the local grocery store. There is a subtle confidence that comes with feeling your soft, clean clothes on your skin and smelling the lively scent of today’s adventure.</p>
